# BillSplit
# By Akshay V Kaushik
Bill Splitter is a Mobile Application built on Android Studio and java. 
It is a demonstration of the Algorithm that I designed and developed to minimize the number of transactions when splitting a bill using Knapsack algorithm as our inspiration. 

This is an Application that makes the splitting of bill among a group much easier, faster and simpler.

I minimize the number of transactions among the members of a group to settle their share of payment when a certain bill has been given and certain people from the group have paid.

This is still the initial version that is being pitched and is subject to a lot of change.
